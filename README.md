# react2gatsby_images

Script to change ReactJS img imports format to Gatsby img imports format. 

Basically  **src={src}** to **src="../src"**

This is especially useful if you have a bunch of this imports.

## Run Locally

First, you need to create a **input/** and **output/** folders at the same level of the script. After that, put your js files into the **input/** folder.
Then just run the script

```bash
  python3 main.py
```

And that's it! Your modified files will be in the **output/** folder.
